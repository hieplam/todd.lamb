## Responsibilities

- Build all pages to static HTML via `astro build` using bun as the package manager and task runner.
- Validate content frontmatter at build time via Zod schemas defined in `src/content.config.ts`.
- Serve a Pagefind search index generated as a post-build step.
- Deploy deterministically to Cloudflare Pages from the `dist/` output.
- Maintain SEO correctness: canonical URLs, sitemap, RSS feed, robots.txt, and OG images.
- Enforce accessibility and responsive layout via TailwindCSS 4 utility classes and semantic HTML.
- Run CI (lint, format check, build) on every push and pull request, and automate releases via release-please on merges to `main`.

## Complexity Assessment

Moderate. Single deployment boundary with no server-side runtime; all complexity lives in the build pipeline (Astro + Zod + Pagefind + Satori/Sharp) and in the content authoring conventions (frontmatter schema, draft/scheduled post logic, tag taxonomy).
